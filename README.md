The project was bootstrapped with Create-react-app and developed using Redux and Styled Components.
The folder structure is the following one:

- __tests__/ - includes some unit tests
- actions/ - their definitions and types
- api/ - data fetching from http://libraries.io
- assets/ - icons used in the app
- components/ - presentational (styles, markup)
- containers/ - smart/logic components
- reducers/ - mutations of the state
- styles/ - variables definitions for colors, sizes..

## Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm test`

### `npm run build`

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
